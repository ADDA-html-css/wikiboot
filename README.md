## Objective
- Get practice using Bootstrap by creating a wiki style site.

## Directions
- Use bootstrap to create a 'wiki' style page for a subject that you are interested in.
- You site should have the following
	+ a main navbar
	+ a landing page
	+ 2 'content' pages
	+ Bonus - a gallery style page, use `class="thumbnails"`, see bootstrap docs for more info.
- Be creative and have fun with it!

## Starter Code
- index.html, this is your landing page, has bootstrap loaded through a CDN.
- manual.css, this is your custom css page, use it to add css and override anything bootstrapped.
